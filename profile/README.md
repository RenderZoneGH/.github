# ðŸ™‹Hi! Welcome to the RenderZone GitHub orgaization. 
RenderZone is a free animted grahpics generator that works online. It is easy to use and very intuitive. 

## Oh cool, is it open-source?
No, RenderZone is not Open-Source and will  _never_ be.

## Umm, what do you have here then?
We have our brand assets, blog posts and other resouces.

## So what should I do  here?
Depends on who you are! 

- If you are a developer, maybe check out [How was it  made?](https://github.com/renderzone/renderzone/wiki/How-was-it-made%3F)
- If you like writing (I don't)  maybe you can contribute a post to our [Blog repositry](https://github.com/renderzone/blog), and we will post it
- If you need our branding assets, [I mean they're right here](https://github.com/renderzone/brand-assets).
- If you're a random person, you could just look arround I guess.
